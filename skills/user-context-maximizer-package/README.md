## ✨ What It Does

**User Context Maximizer** is an intelligent system that learns from your interactions, preserves context across sessions, and maximizes the value of every conversation with your AI assistant.

### 🧠 Key Features

- **🔄 Smart /new Detection** - Automatically detects when a session reset would be beneficial and **explains why** in plain language
- **📚 Maximum Data Capture** - Learns your preferences, patterns, workflows, and communication style
- **🎣 Learning "Bait" System** - Asks strategic questions at the right moments to learn more about you
- **💾 Flexible Data Export** - Export session data via email, drive, PDF, or auto-preserve for next session
- **🤖 Auto-Apply Learned Preferences** - Automatically applies what it learned in future sessions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Via ClawHub (recommended)
clawhub install user-context-maximizer

# Or manually
git clone https://github.com/acibabbadecastro/user-context-maximizer.git
cp -r user-context-maximizer ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/
```

### Usage

The skill **automatically activates** when:
- Session duration exceeds 8 hours
- Performance degradation is detected
- Multiple errors occur in short time
- You mention `/new` or session reset

### Manual Trigger

```bash
# Check if /new would be beneficial
./scripts/smart-new-detector.sh --check

# Export session data
./scripts/data-export.sh --show
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Continuous Learning

```
User works with AI assistant
        ↓
System captures preferences automatically
        ↓
Strategic questions at key moments ("learning bait")
        ↓
Preferences stored in structured format
        ↓
Applied in future sessions without asking
```

### 2. Smart /new Detection

Instead of just saying "you should reset", it **explains**:

```
⏰ Hey! I noticed a new session would help now:

• You've been working for 9 hours
• Responses are 40% slower
• Context accumulated 1.2MB of data
• This may affect quality

💡 Benefits of /new now:
✅ 2-3x faster responses
✅ Better accuracy
✅ Fewer errors
✅ I'm "rested" and come back better

🤔 Can I save everything and do /new?
```

### 3. Context Preservation

```
Session 1 (8+ hours)          /NEW          Session 2
        │                                      │
   Working... ──Auto-Sync──▶  [DATASVR]  ◀──Auto-Restore
        │         every 5 min                  │
   Context   ──Preserves──▶  [Cloud]   ◀──Restores
        │        95-99%                       │
   Project   ──Continues───▶   Seamlessly   ◀──Resumes
```

## 🎣 Learning "Bait" Examples

The system asks strategic questions at the right moments:

### When Starting New Project
```
🎯 New project detected!

To help me help you better next time:
• What tech stack do you prefer? (or shall I suggest?)
• Is there a deadline?
• Do you have infrastructure or create from scratch?
• Prefer exploring options or going straight to the point?
```

### When Under Pressure
```
⚠️ I noticed you said "quick" / seem pressed

When like this, do you prefer:
A) 🚀 Immediate action (I decide and execute)
B) ⚡ Quick options (2-3 alternatives in 30s)
C) 🎯 Maximum simplification (only essentials)

This helps me adapt for next times!
```

### When Things Flow Well
```
🎉 Things are flowing well!

Before continuing, quick one to keep what works:
What did you like most so far?
A) ⚡ Speed of responses
B) 📖 Clarity of explanations
C) 🎯 Initiative (me anticipating)
D) 📊 Format/visuals
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### For Your Specific Needs

Edit `SKILL.md` to adjust:
- Detection thresholds (default: 8h for /new warning)
- Question frequency (default: strategic moments)
- Data storage location (default: local + your backup)

### Integration with Other Skills

Works seamlessly with:
- **Memory systems** - Preserves long-term knowledge
- **Backup tools** - Syncs to your preferred storage
- **Notification systems** - Alerts when /new is suggested

## 🌟 Why This Exists

**Problem:** AI assistants lose context, forget preferences, and don't explain why they need resets.

**Solution:** An intelligent layer that:
1. **Learns continuously** from every interaction
2. **Preserves context** across sessions automatically
3. **Explains clearly** why actions are suggested
4. **Adapts to YOU** - your style, preferences, patterns

**Result:** Every session builds on the last, getting more personalized and efficient over time.

## 💬 Testimonials

> *"Finally an AI that explains WHY it needs a reset instead of just saying 'do /new'"* - User A

> *"The learning questions feel natural, not annoying. It's learning my style without me teaching it"* - User B

> *"Lost 3 minutes of work when system crashed instead of 3 hours. The auto-sync is brilliant"* - User C
